# gpt-model-manager

A web application for managing, reviewing, and comparing custom GPT models. Features include user authentication, model submission, real-time updates, and a system for requesting and displaying real-time reviews using data from a GitHub repository. The front end will include search functionality and dynamic listing of GPT models. The back end will integrate with MongoDB Atlas for data storage, using Node.js and Express for API management. Additionally, the app will be designed as a PWA with offline capabilities and push notifications.
